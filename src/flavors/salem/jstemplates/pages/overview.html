<h1>About</h1>

<p>We want our sidewalks and streets to be safe, so that children and families can walk or bike around their neighborhoods, to school, and to play areas. Please help us by identifying unsafe conditions on a route that you use and giving us suggestions about how to improve them.</p>

<p>This information will be shared with the principals and parents associations of each school, relevant neighborhood associations, city organizations, and city departments as applicable to assist them with their own planning and safety initiatives.</p> 

<h3>Travel survey!</h3>
<p>If you have school age children please <a href="http://masaferoutessurvey.com/en/" title="School Commute Survey">go here and fill out this quick survey on how they get to school</a>. It is completely anonymous and will help inform further analysis of the data collected on the map.</p>
